    "Sentiment Analysis Using News and Indicators": [
      "When analyzing a stock, recent news headlines can strongly influence market sentiment. Positive headlines often signal optimism (e.g., strong earnings, product launches, upgrades), while negative headlines suggest fear or caution (e.g., legal issues, missed earnings, macroeconomic risks).\n\nTechnical indicators can confirm or contradict the sentiment:\n- If the news is positive and the RSI is below 30 (oversold), the stock may be undervalued and likely to rise.\n- If the news is negative and the RSI is above 70 (overbought), the stock may be overpriced and due for a correction.\n- A bullish MACD crossover (MACD line crossing above signal) combined with upbeat news supports a strong upward trend.\n- A bearish MACD crossover along with negative headlines suggests continued downward pressure.\n\nWhen combining indicators with news:\n1. Use news to detect emotional and macro shifts.\n2. Use technicals to confirm price action and momentum.\n3. Always check if the sentiment is priced in or divergent from indicators.\n\nExample: If Apple (AAPL) releases strong quarterly results and the MACD turns bullish, with RSI around 45, this likely indicates healthy upside with moderate buying pressure."
